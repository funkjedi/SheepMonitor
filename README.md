# SheepMonitor

SheepMonitor provides various methods of notification to help you keep track of your flock. It is primarily designed with mages in mind however it should also work with other crowd control spells like Hex and Hibernate (this has not been tested). SheepMonitor can provide you with a visual notifier (status bar), raid-style warnings, chat message, and party/raid notifications. Included in the notifications is the name of who broke cc and the source of the damage.

To move the default visual notifier (status bar) simply right click and drag.
